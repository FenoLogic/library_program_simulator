# library_program_simulator
Hello everyone! This was my very first real project,made back in 2025 along with 3 other junior developers. It simulates a program used to manage the finances (clearly with false money) of a library,along with a game of blackjack integrated. For any feedback,feel free to contact me. I´m always happy to find ways to improve!

IMPORTANT: This code requires the attached image to be downloaded in C:/Users/Usuario/Downloads/Library progarm simulator project/DMP.png If you do not wish to download the image,make sure to delete lines 785-790 to make the program work correctly.
